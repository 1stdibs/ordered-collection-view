  "description": "CollectionView manages a list of DOM elements using a Backbone.Collection  - call orderDOMAccordingToCollection to synchronize the child elements of your view with options.collection.    - Models that are in options.collection that do not correspond to direct children of this.el are used to construct new views using options.construct and appended to this.el    - Direct children of this.el that do not correspond to a model in options.collection are detached.    - Direct children of in this.el are ordered according to the index of their corresponding model in this.collection.        Re-ordering is performed in-place to minimize the commotion that the DOM is subjected to.  - call orderCollectionAccordingToDOM to synchronize the elements in options.collection with the child elements of this.el.    - Models in options.collection that are do not correspond to direct children of this.el are removed from options.collection.    - Elements that are direct children of this.el, but do not correspond to a model in the collection are left alone.    - The remaining models in the collection are sorted according to the order in which they appear relative to their siblings",
